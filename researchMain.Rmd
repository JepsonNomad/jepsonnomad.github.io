"We must accept that time is not completely separate from and independent of space, but is combined with it to form an object called spacetime."  
-Stephen Hawking, in *A Brief History of Time*

My research focuses on relationships among plants, animals, and the role of climate on these interactions. I combine detailed field observations with remote sensing data (i.e. satellite and time-lapse cameras) to look at long-term processes in hyper-speed. For example: Can you find the bighorn sheep moving across the mountain in this time-lapse video? We're looking at 20 real-life minutes compressed into 30 seconds of video time, so they appear to move pretty fast!

I'm particularly interested in the importance of spacetime in shaping ecological patterns and processes. At the end of the day, I like to study animal movement and migration, and the factors that give rise to these behaviors.

In the past, I have contributed to work ranging from skin cancer to archaeology, but nowadays my work is pretty much limited to climate change ecology.
