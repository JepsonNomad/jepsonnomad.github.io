*We must accept that time is not completely separate from and independent of space, but is combined with it to form an object called spacetime.*  
-Stephen Hawking, in *A Brief History of Time*

My research focuses on relationships among plants, animals, and the role of climate on these interactions. I combine detailed field observations with remote sensing data (i.e. satellite and time-lapse cameras) to look at long-term processes in hyper-speed. For example: Can you find the bighorn sheep moving across the mountain in this time-lapse video? We're looking at 20 real-life minutes compressed into 30 seconds of video time, so they appear to move pretty fast - you'll have to look closely!

I'm particularly interested in the importance of spacetime in shaping ecological patterns and processes. At the end of the day, I like to study animal movement and migration, and the factors that give rise to these behaviors.

In the past, I have contributed to work ranging from skin cancer to archaeology, but nowadays my work is pretty much limited to climate change ecology.

*“Where am I?” said Billy Pilgrim.*  
*“Trapped in another blob of amber, Mr. Pilgrim. We are where we have to be just now – three hundred million miles from Earth, bound for a time warp which will get us to Tralfamadore in hours rather than centuries.”*  
*“How – how did I get here?”*  
*“It would take another Earthling to explain it to you. Earthlings are the great explainers, explaining why this event is structured as it is, telling how other events may be achieved or avoided. I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is. Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as I’ve said before, bugs in amber.”*  
-Kurt Vonnegut, in *Slaughterhouse Five*
