My name is Christian John. I'm a landscape ecologist investigating the role of climate change on seasonal ecological processes. Finding this small corner of the research world has been a long adventure, starting with a biology lab in high school that mostly consisted of catching salamanders, plus a simple statistical analysis or two. Since then, I have dabbled in skin cancer, hummingbirds, and archaeology. Most of my work now seeks to understand how populations, communities, and ecosystems change in space and time.

I:
- Hike a lot
- Take a ton of pictures
- Work on the computer more than I'd like to

If I'm not working, I'm probably making coffee, running, or thinking about sailing. No, I don't have a sailboat. Yes, I'll take your grandma's old wooden sunfish off her hands for her.
