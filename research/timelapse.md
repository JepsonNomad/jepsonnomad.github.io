Time-lapse photography is the repeated collection of pictures from a fixed camera position. Time-lapse is typically compiled into videos, and allows researchers to monitor year(s)-long patterns and processes, without staying at one research plot the whole time.

Here's a short video on how I've been using time-lapse in both research and classroom settings.
