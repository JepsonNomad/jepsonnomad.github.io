What follow are some cool maps I've made. 

### North American tundras

Arctic and alpine tundra landscapes of North America are found at high latitudes and elevations, with decreasing density and contiguity toward the south. These seasonal environments are characterized by harsh cold winters and shortlived beautiful summers.

### Bioclimatic distribution forecasts for North American Bovidae

<img src="/img/pubs/ECE2022.ong" alt="Distribution of North American bovids." height="500">

Bovids - members of the cattle family - are distributed across open and rugged landscapes of North America. Here we report on end-of-century model projections from a machine learning species distribution modeling exercise using data from museum collections, universities, and community science efforts.

### Caribou migration routes threatened by proposed roads

<img src="/img/maps/John_2025_figure3.png" alt="Road plans that could impact caribou migration." height="500">

Caribou migratory routes such as those of the Western Arctic herd and Kangerlussuaq-Sisimiut herd could be impacted by the development of roads (black lines), which are proposed to overlap with caribou's seasonal ranges (white winter hatched and summer cross-hatched polygons) or migratory corridors.

### Circumarctic distribution of dwarf birch and grey willow

### Study site in low-arctic Greenland

<img src="/img/maps/Eikelenboom_et_al_2021.jpg" alt="Map of study site at the calving range of the Kangerlussuaq-Sisimiut Caribou Herd." height="250">

Map of the study site at the calving grounds of the Kangerlussuaq-Sisimiut caribou herd, a population whose distribution is bounded by the Davis Strait, Nordre Isortoq, Sukkertoppen Ice Cap, and Greenland's Inland Ice. Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut indicated by K and S, respectively.

### Study site in the eastern Sierra

<img src="/img/maps/RSEC_2023.jpg" alt="Map of study site at the calving range of the Kangerlussuaq-Sisimiut Caribou Herd." height="250">

Map of the study area in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. We used a network of 135 time-lapse cameras (A) distributed across the range of endangered Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep (B) to track patterns of snowmelt and plant growth relevant to their migration, spanning from the Owens Valley to the High Sierra (C).
